# Breakout
An implementation of the classic game breakout using Lua language and Love2D Framework. This game was built with source files provided in the class: GD50: Intro to Game Development through Edx and Harvard.

I have tried to develop these games beyond the assignment requirements.
Here are the features that I added since submission:
- Power Ups
  - Multi-ball
  - Key (Unlocks Special Bricks)
  - Slow Ball
  - Fast Ball
  - Grow Ball
  - Shrink Ball
  - Life
- Paddle shrinks when life is lost and grows when a certain score is reached.
